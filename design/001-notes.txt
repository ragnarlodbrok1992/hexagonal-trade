1. Hexagonal Trade - game.

  Game about trading good between cities (ports? outposts?) on a hexagonal grid.
  To confuse things the game will be in real time.
  Not much to say here at the start, but we will come up with something as we go along.
  Now onto free flow of ideas.

2. Ideas - design for starters, might trim later (or not).

  - 3D hexagonal grid with different textures (texture-maps), heights and custom voxel based water.

3. Tasks - what needs to be done to make this things happen

  - Opening window - Should we use create_window function? [DONE]
  - Add GL library and SIMP library [DONE] for Simp
  - Render triangle and hexagon (2D ish)
  - Add movable camera (mouse and keyboard)
  - Add lines and grid as debugable UI elements
  - Create a 3D model of hexagonal grid as a base
  - Create a hexmap of hexagonal grid models
  - Create different element that will be a voxel based water @TODO(ragnar): This requires more research
    - Those are connecting and animate together
  - Create a geometry on hexagonal grids as entities
    - Buildings
    - Ports
    - Trees
