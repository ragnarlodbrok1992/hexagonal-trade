1. Hexagonal Trade - game.

  Game about trading good between cities (ports? outposts?) on a hexagonal grid.
  To confuse things the game will be in real time.
  Not much to say here at the start, but we will come up with something as we go along.
  Now onto free flow of ideas.

2. Ideas - design for starters, might trim later (or not).

  - 3D hexagonal grid with different textures (texture-maps), heights and custom voxel based water.

3. Tasks - what needs to be done to make this things happen

  - Opening window - Should we use create_window function? [DONE]
  - Add GL library and SIMP library
